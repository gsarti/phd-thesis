The test setup followed an empirical methodology. A random subset of the entire new content produced in our company during a given year was translated with statistical MT engines trained on data from the previous year. The translation environment recorded translation and post-editing times for each sentence. The results show a productivity increase for each participant, with signiﬁcant variance across inviduals.},
